# About Me
Hey, I'm Jacob Gibson, but most of my friends call me Jake. I'm currently working toward a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Media Arts & Sciences 
for Game Design at IUPUI. I've been interested in games for nearly as long as I can remember and my passion for programming game mechanics has only been on the rise!

I work best in OOP languages like C++, C#, and Java, but I'm also familiar with other languages. I love trying to reverse engineer interesting mechanics in both
games and other software. My drive for interesting problem solving and experimentation has brought me to a wide variety of fun projects that I've made throughout
my programming career. Check out some of those projects below!

Relevant Coursework: Calculus I & II, Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Architecture of Computers, 
Advanced Game Design, Game Design Psychology and Prototyping

# Game Development Projects
* [Competitive FPS](https://github.com/WebG1itch/FPSPracticeSource): A dedicated server authoritative, matchmaking ready, fully networked FPS project I made in Unreal Engine 5 uisng C++ to hone my AAA development skills.
* [JumpShip!](https://github.com/WebG1itch/JumpShipSource): A mobile and browser game build in unity with a small group of friends to see what we could do. Check it out on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MuuMuuGames.JumpShip) or [itch.io](https://muumuugames.itch.io/jump-ship)
* Wild Midwest: Coming December 2022, this Unreal Engine 5 project is a simplified real-time strategy game made mostly with Blueprints to make sure I am familiar with all types of workflows. 
* [Micro Snake](https://github.com/WebG1itch/MicroSnake): Using SFML, I built my own implementation of Snake in C++.... but it's at 150x50px :D

# General Programming Projects
* [Roulette Discord Bot](https://github.com/WebG1itch/OpenSourceDiscordBot): Built in Python with the discord.py library, I built this to learn more about the Discord API and have some fun with friends
* [Portfolio Webstite](https://github.com/WebG1itch/PortfolioSite): You can find this site hosted here: [jacobgibson.info](https://jacobgibson.info). I built this from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JS
* [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/WebG1itch/BinarySearchTree): This binary search tree implementation finds a specified k-th smallest number. Built in C++
* [B-Tree](https://github.com/WebG1itch/B-Tree): An implementation of the B-Tree that will add a specified `n` number of random numbers, then traverse the tree and print all values from `n` to `2n`. Built in C++
* [Heap Merging](https://github.com/WebG1itch/HeapMerging): This program will merge a pre-determined heap with another. Built in C++
* [nQueens](https://github.com/WebG1itch/nQueens): A text based version of the nQueens problem. This project will take an input `n` and place that many queens on a text based board. Built in C++
* [Spell Checker](https://github.com/WebG1itch/SpellChecker): An implementation of a hash table, this spell checker will take an input from the user and suggest a new word if it can't find the input in its dictionary. Built in C++
* More to come :)
